### Installing
```
git clone https://github.com/Neguhs/BestBuy-Monitor.git

npm install or npm i

node app.js
```

### Setup 

Make sure to add your server webhook within the `setting.json` file before starting the application or you will run into an error and the app will close.

Here is an example sku **"6364255"** , each sku should be seperated with a `,`.

`Webhook:` Destination of all notifications sent from the monitor.

`Skus:` A collection of all the items you want monitored.

`Interval:` Time in between each time the monitor will check on your list of products you've entered. This value is adjustable but be mindful of potential banning of your IP and or other anti-bot / rate-limiting measures.


```
{
    "Discord":{
        "Webhook": ""
    },
    "Skus":[],
    "Interval": 5000
}
```
